# DEEPSEARCH ARSENAL | ZERO TRUST ARCHITECTURE (v8.1)

> **"Trust No One. Verify Everything."**

![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Operational-green) ![Platform](https://img.shields.io/badge/Platform-Windows_PowerShell-blue) ![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-v8.1_Enterprise-cyan)

**DeepSearch Arsenal** is a military-grade cybersecurity framework designed for Windows environments. Unlike standard script collections, it operates on a **Zero Trust Kernel Architecture**, forcing strict verification for every process. It combines Offensive Red Team capabilities, Defensive Blue Team hardening, and advanced OSINT reconnaissance into a single, modular Hypervisor.

## ⚡ Key Features

* **Kernel Hypervisor (v8.1):** A central command center that manages all subsystems with error handling and crash protection.
* **Modular Architecture:** Tools are isolated into 5 operational divisions (OSINT, DEFENSE, OFFENSE, NET_OPS, MAINTENANCE).
* **Zero Trust Vault:** Critical data is encrypted using **AES-256** standards.
* **Watchdog Protocol:** Background monitoring system that ensures the Kernel remains active and uncompromised.
* **Stealth Mode:** Tools operate largely in memory to minimize forensic footprint.

## 📂 System Architecture

The system is organized into a strict hierarchy:

```text
DEEPSEARCH_ZEROTRUST/
├── 💀 BOOTLOADER/         # System Startup & Integrity Checks
├── 🧠 CORE_ENGINE/        # The Kernel (Brain of the system)
├── 🔒 VAULT/              # Encrypted Storage (AES-256)
├── 💾 DATA/               # Logs, Loot, and Performance History
└── 🛠 MODULES/            # Operational Tools
    ├── 🕵️ OSINT/          # Intelligence Gathering
    ├── 🛡 DEFENSE/        # System Hardening & Traps
    ├── ⚔️ OFFENSE/        # Red Team & Stress Testing
    ├── 📡 NET_OPS/        # Network Stealth & Firewall
    └── 🔧 MAINTENANCE/    # Health & Forensic Cleaning

```

## 🛠 The Arsenal (Tool List)

### 1. 🕵️ OSINT (Intelligence)

* **Social Profile Scanner:** Hunts a target username across 50+ social media platforms.
* **Vehicle Recon:** Analyzes vehicle plates to identify region and automates registry/challan searches.
* **Phone Recon:** Extracts digital footprints from phone numbers (WhatsApp, TrueCaller, UPI).
* **Metadata Stripper:** "Digital Shredder" that removes GPS/EXIF data from photos for safe uploading.
* **Ghost Protocol:** (Legacy) System clipboard and history forensics.

### 2. 🛡 DEFENSE (Blue Team)

* **NIST Scout:** Audits system security against US Gov (NIST/CIS) benchmarks. Returns a Compliance Score (0-100%).
* **Ransomware Shield:** Creates a heuristic "Canary Trap" file. If modified, it locks the system and sounds an alarm.
* **Active Deception:** Deploys fake honey-tokens to confuse attackers.
* **USB Sentry:** Monitors and logs USB insertion events.

### 3. ⚔️ OFFENSE (Red Team)

* **Wifi Harvester:** Extracts and decrypts cleartext passwords for all previously connected Wi-Fi networks.
* **Packet Storm:** Network Stress Tester (DoS Simulator) to validate firewall rules.
* **Shadow Login:** Social Engineering tool that mimics a Windows Update screen to capture credentials.
* **Time Machine:** System snapshot and restore utility.

### 4. 📡 NET_OPS (Network Operations)

* **Net Ghost:** The Identity Shifter. Automates MAC Spoofing and DNS Hopping (Cloudflare/Quad9).
* **Port Fortress:** Visual Firewall Manager. Block/Allow ports (e.g., `block 445`) via simple commands.
* **Save Me:** Emergency panic button to kill network connections.

### 5. 🔧 MAINTENANCE (Forensics)

* **Titan Health:** Predictive maintenance engine. Logs performance history to predict hardware failure.
* **Virus Terminator:** Forensic malware cleaner. Scans specific drives and unhides data on infected USBs.
* **AES Crypt:** The core encryption engine used by the Vault.

## 🚀 Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites

* Windows 10 / 11
* PowerShell 5.1 or newer
* Administrator Privileges (Required for Packet Storm & Net Ghost)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository or extract the `DEEPSEARCH_ZEROTRUST` folder.
